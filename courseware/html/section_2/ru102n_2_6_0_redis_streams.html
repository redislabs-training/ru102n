<h1>Redis Streams</h1>

<p>
    Redis Streams are an append-only log like data structure that allows you to enqueue messages from producers to be consumed by consumers in
    your application. They are powerful data structure with a rich feature set, and for a full explanation as to how and why to use Redis Streams,
    you can checkout <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru202/">RU202: Redis Streams.</a>
</p>

<p>
    In this section, we'll explore using Redis Streams in .NET using the StackExchange.Redis library. We'll learn how to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add Messages to a Stream</li>
    <li>Read Messages from a Stream</li>
    <li>Read Messages from a Stream in a Consumer Group</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Stream Limitations in StackExchange.Redis</h2>

<p>
    Due to the multiplexed nature of StackExchange.Redis, it's important to note at the top that there is no mechanism for using the blocking
    paradigms available within the stream reading operations. This means that the Stream Read operations, StreamRead & StreamReadGroup, will
    not be able to use the XREAD and XREADGROUP block timer or the special <i>$</i> id to read only new messages.
