<h1>Redis Transactions</h1>

<p>
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/transactions/">Transactions</a> in Redis allow you to apply multiple commands in in isolation to Redis
    sequentially. StackExchange.Redis exposes the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ITransaction</span> which operationally is similar to the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IBatch</span>
    in that it allows you to dispatch a series of tasks, which you can then await after calling the <<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">>Execute</span> method
    to run the transaction.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IBatch</span> however, all commands sent through a transaction are guaranteed to be executed
    sequentially. And you can apply some limited conditions to the transaction to allow it to self terminate if a watched
    key changes. In this section we'll learn how to work with Transactions in StackExchange.Redis.
