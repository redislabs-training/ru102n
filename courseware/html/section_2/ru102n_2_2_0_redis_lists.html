<h1>Working with Redis Lists</h1>

<p>
    Redis Lists are doubly linked lists that allow you to push and pop from the front and
    tail. This allows you to build what are in essence queues and stacks of Redis Strings.
    The StackExchange.Redis library provides an intuitive interface for working with Lists
    in the <code>IDatabase</code> that we will go over in this section.
