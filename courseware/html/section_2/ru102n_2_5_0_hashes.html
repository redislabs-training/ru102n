<h1>Redis Hashes with StackExchange.Redis</h1>

<p>
    Hashes are a simple, but very powerful data structure available within Redis. Hashes are similar to dictionaries in that they allow you to
    organize a set of key-value pairs at a particular key within Redis. In this section we'll look at how to use hashes using the StackExchange.Redis
    library.
