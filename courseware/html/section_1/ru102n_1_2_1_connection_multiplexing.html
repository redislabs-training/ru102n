    The most fundamental architectural feature of StackExchange.Redis is Connection Multiplexing.
    The library leans heavily on a class called the <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer</span>. This
    class is responsible for arbitrating all connections to Redis, and routing all commands
    you want to send through the library through a single connection.
</p>

<p>
    That's right, a single connection. The <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer</span> opens exactly
    2 connections per Redis Server, one of which is the interactive command connection to Redis,
    the other being the subscription connection for the pub/sub API which we'll explore later.
</p>

<p>
    Like everything else in computing and software development, this approach has both benefits
    and tradeoffs.
</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>
    The ConnectionMultiplexer has proven to be extremely performant and robust. It's a powerhouse
    for pushing commands through to Redis.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The single connection multiplexer matches the cardinality of Redis Threads. 
        There's only one command thread in Redis, so sending additional commands concurrently
        doesn't help much as they will be waiting to be serviced by the command thread.
    </li>
    <li>
        It minimizes the number of sockets your application needs to open and maintain and
        wards off Socket Exhaustion.
    </li>
    <li>
        The multiplexer will maximize usage of your sockets, and automatically pipeline commands
        sent concurrently.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>

<p>
    As with every other endeavour in software development, any architectural choice as profound
    as the ConnectionMultiplexer has some tradeoff. We'll explore these in more detail throughout the
    course, but here are they are at a top level.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Head-of-line blockages can occur with large payloads blocking out other requests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Blocking commands, e.g. blocking stream reads, the blocking list/sorted set commands
        cannot be used. This is because blocking the interactive connection will block out
        threads trying to use the connection concurrently.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transactions work a bit differently, we'll talk about them later in the course, 
        but they are a tad different in that they don't fully support
        watches, and no command in a transaction is dispatched to Redis
        until execution time.
    </li>
</ul>
