<h1>Connect to Redis!</h1>
<p>
    Now that we've added StackExchange.Redis to the project, we can move into our first
    Hands-On exercise, connecting to Redis! You can follow along with this Hands-On by opening
    <code>/src/section_1/section1.2/section1.2.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    There are two methods that you can use to connect to Redis: <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect</span>
    and <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer.ConnectAsync</span> - either will work. You'll need the parameters
    that you collected at setup:
    <ul>
        <li>hostname</li>
        <li>port</li>
        <li>password (if on Redis Cloud or otherwise password protected)</li>
        <li>username (if not <span class="code">default</span>)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    There are essentially two overloads, one taking a connection string, and the other taking an instance of the 
    <span class="code">ConfigurationOptions</span> class, which is definitely
    easier to organize, but the connection string option is often easier for a simple connection.
</p>

<h3>Connection String</h3>
<p>
    The Connection string is just a comma delimited string of different configuration paramaters, any <code>hostname:port</code>
    formatted argument in the connection string is treated as it's own endpoint, while any <code>param=val</code> formatted argument
    is treated as a parameter value. So the connection string:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;" class="code sh literal-block">
    redis-1:6379,password=foobar
</pre>

<p>
    Equates to StackExchange.Redis connecting to the host "redis-1", port 6379, and using the password "foobar" as it's password.
</p>

<h3>ConfigurationOptions</h3>

<p>
    The <code>ConfigurationOptions</code> class allows for parameterized construction of a collection of options for the multiplexer.
    The equivalent options to our connection string above would be:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;" class="code cs literal-block">
    var options = new ConfigurationOptions
    {
        EndPoints = new EndPointCollection{"redis-1:6379"},
        Password = "foobar"
    };
</pre>

<h2>Ping Redis</h2>

<p>
    After you've established a connection to Redis. Let's send our very first interactive
    command to Redis!
</p>
<p>
    We'll start off by sending the simplest of Redis commands, Ping. First,
    you'll need to get a handle to an <span class="code">IDatabase</span>, 
    the <span class="code">IDatabase</span> is the main interactive
    command interface for Redis Commands. You can grab it from the Multiplexer
    by calling the <span class="code">GetDatabase</span> 
    method on the <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer</span>.
</p>
<p>
    With that done, all you need to do to ping Redis is call 
    <span class="code">Ping</span>, print the results, and your done!
