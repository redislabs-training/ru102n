<h1>IConnectionMultiplexer</h1>

<p>
    The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IConnectionMultiplexer</span> is responsible for maintaining all of the
    connections to Redis. As I described in the previous section. It routes
    all the commands to Redis through a single connection for interactive commands,
    and a separate connection for subscription, which we'll discuss more in
    depth later. 
</p>

<p>
    The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IConnectionMultiplexer</span> is responsible for exposing a simple interface
    to get other critical interfaces of the library. Including the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IDatabase</span>,
    <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ISubscriber</span>, and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IServer</span>.
