<h1>Hands-On Pipelining</h1>

<p>
    As we just reviewed previously, pipelining can be crucial for increasing
    throughput on your Redis instance. In this exercise, we are going to look at running
    the same collection of tasks in three modes.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Serially and un-pipelined</li>
    <li>Implicitly pipelined</li>
    <li>Explicitly pipelined with <code>IBatch</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
    The completed source is in the course's <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru102n">repository</a>
    under <span class="code">/src/section_1/section1.5/section1.5.csproj</span>. We'll be using the <span class="code">ping</span>
    command in this case, but this will extrapolate to any command, and any sequence of
    commands where the intermediate results are not needed. If you'd like to start from the beginning you can checkout the <span class="code">starting-point</span> branch
    and open the csproj file finding the <span class="code"></span>// TODO for Coding Challenge Start here on starting-point branch</span> in <span class="code">Program.cs</span>.
</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>
    Before we run our examples, let's initialize a Multiplexer, get an instance of an <span class="code">IDatabase</span>
    and create and start a <span class="code">StopWatch</span>:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    using System.Diagnostics;
    using StackExchange.Redis;

    var options = new ConfigurationOptions
    {
        EndPoints = new EndPointCollection { "localhost:6379" }
    };

    var muxer = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(options);
    var db = muxer.GetDatabase();

    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Un-Pipelined</h2>

<p>
    Sending a serial chain of commands that are not pipelined is pretty straight forward.
    For the sake of consistency with the other examples, we'll use the async version of
    the <span class="code">Ping</span> Command. We'll just call and await the result 1000 times. This
    will cause the Multiplexer to wait for the command to complete between runs, and prevent
    it from pipelining the commands automatically. 
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    // un-pipelined commands incur the added cost of an extra round trip
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    {
        await db.PingAsync();
    }

    Console.WriteLine($"1000 un-pipelined commands took: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms to execute");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Implicitly Pipelined</h2>

<p>
    Now let's try using implicit pipelining, in this instance, we will not await each task
    as it's dispatched. Rather we will collect all the tasks and await them all en masse 
    at the end. Each Task is responsible for containing the results of the command after
    the command completes:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    // If we run out async tasks to StackExchange.Redis concurrently, the library
    // will automatically manage pipelining of these commands to Redis, making
    // them significantly more performant as we remove most of the round trips to Redis.
    var pingTasks = new List<Task<TimeSpan>>();

    // restart stopwatch
    stopwatch.Restart();

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    {
        pingTasks.Add(db.PingAsync());
    }

    await Task.WhenAll(pingTasks);

    Console.WriteLine($"1000 automatically pipelined tasks took: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms to execute, first result: {pingTasks[0].Result}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Explicit Pipelining with IBatch</h2>

<p>
    Finally, let's explicitly pipeline all of our pings using an <span class="code">IBatch</span>. An <span class="code">IBatch</span> will
    guarantee that the client sends the entire batch to Redis in one shot, with no other
    commands interleaved in the pipeline. This is slightly different behavior than our
    implicit pipelining as in the case of implicit pipelining, commands may
    be interleaved with any other commands the client was executing at the time.
</p>

<p>
    To explicitly pipeline these commands we'll follow a similar pattern, in this case,
    however, we will use the <span class="code">IDatabase.CreateBatch()</span> method to create the
    batch, and use the batch's async methods to 'dispatch' the the tasks. It's important
    to note here that unlike in our implicit case, the tasks will not be truly dispatched
    until after the <span class="code">IBatch.Execute()</span> method is called, if you try awaiting
    any of the tasks before then, you can accidentally deadlock your command. After calling
    <span class="code">Execute</span>, you can then await all of the tasks.

</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    // clear our ping tasks list.
    pingTasks.Clear();

    // Batches allow you to more intentionally group together the commands that you want to send to Redis.
    // If you employee a batch, all commands in the batch will be sent to Redis in one contiguous block, with no
    // other commands from the client interleaved. Of course, if there are other clients to Redis, commands from those
    // other clients may be interleaved with your batched commands.
    var batch = db.CreateBatch();

    // restart stopwatch
    stopwatch.Restart();

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    {
        pingTasks.Add(batch.PingAsync());
    }

    batch.Execute();
    await Task.WhenAll(pingTasks);
    Console.WriteLine($"1000 batched commands took: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms to execute, first result: {pingTasks[0].Result}");
</pre>
</p>
