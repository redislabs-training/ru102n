<h1>Hands-On with Ad-Hoc Commands and Probabilistic Data Structures</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to use the Ad-Hoc API and Probabilistic Data Structures from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">/src/section_2/section2.1/section2.1.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    The Ad-Hoc Commands are relatively straight forward to work with, they center entirely around two methods in StackExchange.Redis: 
    <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Execute</span> and  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ExecuteAsync</span>. Naturally the primary differentiator between these two methods is whether or not they
    execute asynchronously. These methods each take three parameters:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The command name</li>
    <li>A collection of argument objects for the command</li>
    <li>The Command Flags for the command</li>
</ul>

<h2>Command Name</h2>

<p>
    The Command Name is the name of the main command to be executed. If you look at the commands on the <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/commands/">Command Page of redis.io</a>
    the Command Name is the first word preceding a space in the bold block, for any command with two or more words, only the first is a name, the
    remainder are technically options which must be passed in as arguments.
</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>

<p>
    The arguments parameter can be passed one of two ways. Either using the params macro:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    await db.ExecuteAsync("SET", "foo", "bar");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Or, you can pass them in as a collection:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var arguments = new object[] { "foo", "bar" };
    await db.ExecuteAsync("SET", arguments);
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Both work, the first way requires less code of course, but if you use it, you cannot pass any command flags in, since the params macro must
    be the last argument in the list.
</p>

<h2>Command Flags</h2>

<p>
    Command Flags provide some useful operational features, particularly around server selection and performance tuning. For example, if you
    are running a read-command, and do not want to hit your master shard, you can use the command flag  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">CommandFlags.DemandReplica</span>.
    There are corresponding flags to demand a master shard, prefer a master shard, or prefer a replica shard.
</p>
<p>
    Another really useful thing you can
    drive via the command flags is to set a command to fire-and-forget. If you set a command to fire and forget, StackExchange.Redis will read back
    the result of your command, and release execution as soon as it sends the command to Redis, this can increase throughput, particularly in cases
    where you do not care about the result of a command.
</p>

<h2>Working with Probabilistic Data Structures</h2>

<p>
    Now that we know a little more about using the Ad-Hoc API, let's look a little bit deeper at how to use them with with something that we
    can't emulate with a better structured Library command from the main library.
</p>

<p>
    Probabilistic Data Structures are a specialized family of data structures that allow you to approximate answers to very specific questions about a dataset.
    They're also great for an example as to how to use the ad-hoc api for something really useful. We're going to look at how to use two of 
    these probabilistic data structures.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Bloom Filters</b>: Allows you to very compactly and quickly tell if an item has been added to a set yet.</li>
    <li><b>Top-K</b>: This allows you to keep track of heavy hitters (most frequently seen items) in large streams of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reserve and Add to a Bloom Filter</h2>

<p>
    A bloom filter allows you to quickly tell whether a word may have been added to a set in a space efficient way.  Because false positives can occur, the bloom filter can tell if that something may be or is absolutely not in the set.
</p>
<p>
    Let's demonstrate this by adding all the words from the book Moby Dick to our 
    bloom filter in a relatively compact way. To add to a Bloom Filter, we just need arrange our words in such a way that they're in a sequential
    collection (e.g. an array or list) with the name of the Bloom Filter as the first element, and then each subsequent element being a word we
    want to add to the filter.
</p>
<p>
     A simple aggregation will take care of this pretty after we've parsed out our words from a text document (this work is already done for you in the example).
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var bloomList = words.Aggregate(new List&lt;object&gt; { "bf" }, (list, word) =>
    {
        list.Add(word);
        return list;
    });
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    With the words aggregated together into a much larger argument list, all that's left to do is use the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">BF.RESERVE</span> command to reserve space for the Bloom Filter in Redis, specifying a key name, acceptable error rate and estimate of the size of our data set):
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    await db.ExecuteAsync("BF.RESERVE", "bf", 0.01, 20000);
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Now we use the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">BF.MADD</span> command to add everything to the Bloom Filter in one shot.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    await db.ExecuteAsync("BF.MADD", bloomList, CommandFlags.FireAndForget);
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Reserve and Add to Top-K</h2>

<p>
    The Top-K data structure lets us keep track of who the heavy hitters (most frequently seen items) are in enormous streams of data using the Heavy Keeper Data Structure. To Reserve a
    heavy keeper, all we need to do run the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">TOPK.RESERVE</span> command:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    await db.ExecuteAsync("TOPK.RESERVE", "topk", 10, 20, 10, .925);
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    And then we need to arrange all of our words so that they are not duplicated (this isn't absolutely necessary, but if you are using a cloud
    instance of Redis it will speed things up by saving on network bandwidth) and so that each word is followed by it's count. We'll run a couple quick aggregations against our
    word list to do this:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    // We need to organize the words into a list where each word is followed by the number of occurrences it has in Moby Dick
    var topKList = words.Aggregate(new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;(), (dict, word) =>
    {
        if (!dict.ContainsKey(word))
        {
            dict.Add(word, 0);
        }

        dict[word]++;
        return dict;
    }).Aggregate(new List&lt;object&gt; {"topk"}, (list, kvp) =>
    {
        list.Add(kvp.Key);
        list.Add(kvp.Value);
        return list;
    });
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Then we just need to call <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">TOPK.INCRBY</span> passing in our list of word/count pairs:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    // Add everything to the Top-K
    await db.ExecuteAsync("TOPK.INCRBY", topKList, CommandFlags.FireAndForget);
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Querying our Bloom Filter</h2>

<p>
    Querying the Bloom filter is really simple, you just need to call <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">BF.EXISTS</span>. This will return a <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">RedisResult</span>,
    which is a highly versatile class that StackExchange.Redis uses to abstract the complexity of how the RESP protocol works. Fundamentally
    what it does is pulls in the result, and those results can be converted explicitly (by casting) to whatever the pertinent result type is.
    For <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">BF.EXISTS</span>, Redis will return an integer result. So let's try to work with this a bit. Let's check if the word "the" appears
    in Moby Dick (hint: it does).
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var doesTheExist = await db.ExecuteAsync("BF.EXISTS", "bf", "the");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    There's two things you can do with a <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">RedisResult</span>, you can cast/use it as its appropriate type: supported types are basically
    any value type, arrays, and as a dictionary of strings and RedisResults. If the type is supported by what was returned, and you try to cast it to
    that type, the cast will be successful, so let's try casting it to a couple of different types:   
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var doesTheExistAsInt = (int)doesTheExist;
    Console.WriteLine($"Typeof {nameof(doesTheExistAsInt)}: {doesTheExistAsInt.GetType()}");

    var doesTheExistAsDouble = (double)doesTheExist;
    Console.WriteLine($"Typeof {nameof(doesTheExistAsDouble)}: {doesTheExistAsDouble.GetType()}");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Both of these are Valid casts for our <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">RedisResult</span>, so it works just fine, but if we tried to cast it to something inappropriate (e.g. an
    array of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">RedisResults</span>), it will fail with an <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">InvalidCastException</span>.
</p>
<p>
     The determination as to whether or not a cast is valid is
    based off what Redis actually returned as a result of the command. You can check the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">RedisResult</span> to see what the appropriate
    type is if you are unsure use the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Type</span> property, but the results will follow the format laid out in the 
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/commands">Command Pages on redis.io</a> so you should have a pretty good idea ahead of time as to what you are looking for.
</p>

<h2>Enumerate the Top-K</h2>

<p>
    To Enumerate our Top-K, we just need to call <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">TOPK.LIST</span>. The trick here however, is that we need to cast it to something useable,
    like an array, preferably an array of strings.
</p>
<p>
     To do that, we just need to perform an explicit cast, and then select each as a string.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var res = await db.ExecuteAsync("TOPK.LIST", "topk");
    var arr = ((RedisResult[])res!).Select(x=>x.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine($"Top 10: {string.Join(", ", arr)}");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Finally, if we wanted the counts as of our Top-K as well (which will come back as a dictionary of values), we can easily reduce it to a 
    dictionary, and convert that dictionary to an enumerable that we can use to print out a discernable list of values with their counts using
    the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ToDictionary</span> method.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var withCounts = (await db.ExecuteAsync("TOPK.LIST", "topk", "WITHCOUNT")).ToDictionary().Select(x=>$"{x.Key}: {x.Value}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Top 10, with counts: {string.Join(", ", withCounts)}");
</code>
</pre>
