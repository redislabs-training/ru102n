<h1>Distributed Session State with ASP.NET</h1>

<p>
    ASP.NET has a well established Distributed Session State Provider for Redis called <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Microsoft.Web.RedisSessionStateProvider</span>.
    It allows for a proper Integration of Session State with Redis, and similar to the ASP.NET Core case, is quite easy to get up and running with.
</p>

<p>
    In this section, we'll be walking through a very simple application that leverages Session State, and see how to add Redis as a Provider of
    distributed session state in ASP.NET.
</p>

<p>
    Because this is ASP.NET, this section is considered optional. None of the questions on the final exam will be derived from the material from this
    section. However, if you still work on non-core ASP.NET apps, this can still be quite useful, so if it's useful to you, I'd encourage you 
    to walk through this tutorial.

<h2>Added Prerequisites for this Section</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Because this is an ASP.NET section it necessary for you to have a Windows Machine (preferably Windows 10+) to work on. The reality
        of the .NET Framework is that it only runs on Windows, so you'll need Windows.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must have the <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks">.NET Framework 4.8.1 SDK installed</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        It's highly recommended that you use either Visual Studio or Rider for this section.
    </li>
</ul>
