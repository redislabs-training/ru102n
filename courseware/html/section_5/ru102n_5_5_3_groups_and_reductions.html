<h1>Grouping and Reduction</h1>

<p>
    Redis OM also allows you to group records together by their attributes, and run reductions on the data within each group. Take our Top Salesperson
    example from Section 3. If you wanted to determine who the top salesperson was with our given model, you can group all of our sales by
    the employee ID, then run a summation on the sales, then order by the result of that summation: 
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    // Top Salesperson
    var topSalesId = saleAggregations
        .GroupBy(x=>x.RecordShell.EmployeeId)
        .Sum(x=>x.RecordShell.Total)
        .OrderByDescending(x=>x["Total_SUM"])
        .Take(1)
        .First()["EmployeeId"]
        .ToString();
    var topSalesPerson = await employees.FindByIdAsync(topSalesId);
    Console.WriteLine($"Top seller: {topSalesPerson.Name}");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    When running reductions, the name of the result in the aggregation pipeline is always the attribute's name that the reduction was being
    run on, plus the reduction command's name in screaming caps joined by an underscore. So in our example above the <span class="code">SUM</span> of 
    <span class="code">x.RecordShell.Total</span> comes out to <span class="code">Total_SUM</span>. See the table below for a full enumeration of supported reducers 
    and their command postfixes
</p>
