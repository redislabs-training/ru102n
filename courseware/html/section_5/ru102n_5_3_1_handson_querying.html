<h1>Hands-On Querying Redis with Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to query your documents in Redis with Redis OM .NET.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a RedisConnectionProvider,
    or you can open <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">/src/section_5/section5.3/section5.3.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Make Age and Name Sortable</h2>

<p>
    In this section we'll only be working with Employees, the first thing we need to do is to make a minor update to the model making 
    the name and age sortable, to do this, open <i><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Model.cs</span></i> and change the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IndexedAttribute</span> in the Age and Name property so
    they look like this:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    [Indexed(Sortable = true)]
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Insert some records</h2>

<p>
    Let's now insert some records into Redis. We'll just hard code the 5 people we were using in Unit 3, but they will be slightly more complex
    now because they have some extra fields, e.g. Age and Address (with a geoloc!)
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var alice = new Employee
    {
        Name = "Alice",
        Age = 45,
        Address = new Address { StreetAddress = "Elm Street", Location = new GeoLoc(-81.957, 27.058), PostalCode = "34269" }
    };

    var bob = new Employee
    {
        Name = "Bob",
        Age = 60,
        Address = new Address() { StreetAddress = "Bleecker Street", Location = new GeoLoc(-74.003, 40.732), PostalCode = "10014" }
    };

    var charlie = new Employee
    {
        Name = "Charlie",
        Age = 26,
        Address = new Address() { StreetAddress = "Ocean Boulevard", Location = new GeoLoc(-121.869, 36.604), PostalCode = "93940" }
    };

    var dan = new Employee
    {
        Name = "Dan",
        Age = 42,
        Address = new Address() { StreetAddress = "Baker Street", Location = new GeoLoc(-0.158, 51.523), PostalCode = "NW1 6XE" }
    };

    var yves = new Employee
    {
        Name = "Yves",
        Age = 19,
        Address = new Address() { StreetAddress = "Rue de Rivoli", Location = new GeoLoc(2.361, 48.863), PostalCode = "75003" }
    };

    await employees.InsertAsync(bob);
    await employees.InsertAsync(alice);
    await employees.InsertAsync(charlie);
    await employees.InsertAsync(dan);
    await employees.InsertAsync(yves);
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Our First Query with a String</h2>

<p>
    For our first query, we'll be using the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">First</span> method to find the first employee in Redis named "Bob", This operation
    works exactly how you would expect it would if you've used LINQ in the past:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    Console.WriteLine($"Employees Named Bob");
    var alsoBob = await employees.FirstAsync(x=>x.Name == "Bob");
    Console.WriteLine($"Bob's age is: {alsoBob.Age} and his postal code is: {alsoBob.Address!.PostalCode}");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">FirstAsync</span> method materializes immediately serializing the query in the pipeline and sending it onto Redis.
</p>

<h2>Numeric Range Queries</h2>

<p>
    To query a range, you simply need to use the greater than or less than operators against numeric values, as you would in any other LINQ
    context. Since we are querying multiple records here, we will use a <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Where</span> predicate. Let's try querying all the people under forty:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    // Query by age 
    var employeesUnderForty = employees.Where(x => x.Age &lt; 40);

    Console.WriteLine("----Employees under 40----");
    await foreach (var emp in employeesUnderForty)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{emp.Name} is {emp.Age}");
    }
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Proximity Geo Queries</h2>

<p>
    One of the really neat features of Redis OM .NET is that it give you the ability to perform GeoFilters on your data in Redis. A Geo Filter
    is a radius filter from a point on earth.
</p>
<p>
    You can express a Geo Filter in terms of one of your model's attributes, for example the 
    <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Address.Location</span> attribute, which is a <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">GeoLoc</span>, a special type within Redis for holding a geographic position.
</p>
<p>
    To run a Geo filter, simply provide the attribute as well as the desired center-point of your geo filter, the radius from the center point
    you want to search, and the units you want to use for the filter. For example, if we wanted to find all of the employees within 1500 miles
    of Philadelphia, we can do so like this:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var employeesNearPhilly = await employees.GeoFilter(x=>x.Address!.Location, -75.159, 39.963, 1500, GeoLocDistanceUnit.Miles).ToListAsync();

    Console.WriteLine("----Employees near Philly----");

    foreach (var emp in employeesNearPhilly)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{emp.Name} lives in the postal code: {emp.Address!.PostalCode}");
    }
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Sorting</h2>

<p>
    Any property that has been marked <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Sortable = true</span> in the model definition can be sorted on, to sort on a field, you will use
    an <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">OrderBy</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">OrderByDescending</span> predicate in constructing your query, consequentially, if we wanted to select
    the names of of our employees in Ascending order, we could do so with an <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">OrderBy</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Select</span>:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var employeesByAge = await employees.OrderBy(x=>x.Age).Select(x=>x.Name!).ToListAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"In Ascending order: {string.Join(", ", employeesByAge)}");
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Conversely, if we wanted to order employees names in reverse alphabetical order we could do so with an <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">OrderByDescending</span>:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var employeesInReverseAlphabeticalOrder = await employees.OrderByDescending(x=>x.Name).Select(x=>x.Name!).ToListAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"In Reverse Alphabetical Order: {string.Join(", ", employeesInReverseAlphabeticalOrder)}");
</code>
</pre>
