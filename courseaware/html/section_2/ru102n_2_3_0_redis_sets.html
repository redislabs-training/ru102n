<h1>Redis Sets</h1>

<p>
    Redis Sets are an implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">mathematical set</a>.
    Like mathematical sets they have a number of key properties:    
</p>

<ul>
    <li>They are unordered</li>
    <li>They do not duplication, no repeated members</li>
    <li>They can be combined together to create new sets</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In this section we'll learn about how to leverage these properties use Redis Sets in .NET.
