<h1>Hands-On with Redis Sets</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to use Redis Sets from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <code>/src/section_2/section2.3/section2.3.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    In this example we'll be working with 5 sets of users.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ActiveUsers</li>
    <li>InactiveUsers</li>
    <li>OnlineUsers</li>
    <li>OfflineUsers</li>
    <li>AllUsers</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Let's start out by clearing out the sets we'll be working with from Redis:
</p>

<code>
    var allUsersSet = "users";
    var activeUsersSet = "users:state:active";
    var inactiveUsersSet = "users:state:inactive";
    var offlineUsersSet = "users:state:offline";
    db.KeyDelete(new RedisKey[]{allUsersSet, activeUsersSet,inactiveUsersSet, offlineUsersSet});
</code>

<h2>Populate Sub Sets</h2>

<p>
    Now let's go about populating our active, inactive, and offline user sets. To do this,
    we'll use the <code>SetAdd</code>Method. This method is variadic so we can do it in one
    command for each set.
</p>

<code>
    db.SetAdd(activeUsersSet, new RedisValue[]{"User:1","User:2"});
    db.SetAdd(inactiveUsersSet, new RedisValue[]{"User:3", "User:4"});
    db.SetAdd(offlineUsersSet, new RedisValue[] {"User:5", "User:6", "User:7"});
</code>

<h2>Combining sets to get all users</h2>

<p>
    You'll notice that we did not populate our allUsers set. If we consider active, inactive, offline
    to be an exhaustive list of states, we can use the set combination operations to get a
    set with all of our users. We can even use <code>SetCombineAndStore</code> to store those
    combined users in our all users key.
</p>

<code>
    db.SetCombineAndStore(SetOperation.Union, allUsersSet, new RedisKey[]{activeUsersSet, inactiveUsersSet, offlineUsersSet});
</code>

<h2>Check Membership</h2>

<p>
    Sets do not allow duplication, but they allow very rapid O(1) membership checks. So if 
    wanted to check to see if User:6 is offline we could do so very easily
</p>

<code>
    var user6Offline = db.SetContains(offlineUsersSet, "User:6");
    Console.WriteLine($"User:6 offline: {user6Offline}");
</code>

<h2>Enumerate Set</h2>

<p>
    When you want to enumerate the members of a set, you have two options, you can enumerate
    them all in one shot, or you can scan over the set and enumerate everything. We'll go
    over how to do each of those here.
</p>

<h3>Enumerate Entire Set</h3>

<p>
    If you want to guarantee that you are enumerating the entire set in one round trip, 
    you can do so by using the <code>SetMembers</code> method. This will uses <code>SMEMBERS</code> 
    command in Redis. If your set is relatively compact (under 1000 members), this is a
    perfectly valid way to pull back all of your set members.
</p>

<code>
    Console.WriteLine($"All Users In one shot: {string.Join(", ", db.SetMembers(allUsersSet))}");
</code>

<h3>Enumerate Set in Chunks</h3>

<p>
    The alternate way to enumerate a set is to enumerate it <code>SetScan</code>, which will
    create a Set Enumerator, and use the <code>SSCAN</code> to scan over the entire set until
    the set is exhausted.
</p>

<code>
    Console.WriteLine($"All Users with scan  : {string.Join(", ", db.SetScan(allUsersSet))}");
</code>

<h2>Move Elements Between Sets</h2>

<p>
    A very typical operation you might need to perform with sets is to move elements between
    them. For example if <code>User:1</code> were to move offline, you can use <code>SetMove</code>
    to move them from the active user set to the offline user set.
</p>

<code>
    Console.WriteLine("Moving User:1 from active to offline");
    var moved = db.SetMove(activeUsersSet, offlineUsersSet, "User:1");
    Console.WriteLine($"Move Successful: {moved}");
</code>
